# The Gambler

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere<br>
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep<br>
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness<br>
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak<br>

And knowin' what their cards were<br>
By the way they held their eyes<br>
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces<br>
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice<br>

So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow<br>
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light<br>
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression<br>
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy<br>
You gotta learn to play it right"<br>

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run<br>
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table<br>
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done<br>

Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'<br>
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep<br>
'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser<br>
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep<br>

And when he finished speakin'<br>
He turned back towards the window<br>
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep<br>
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even<br>
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep<br>

You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run<br>
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table<br>
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done<br>

You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)<br>
Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run<br>
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table<br>
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done<br>
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em<br>
Know when to walk away and know when to run<br>
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table<br>
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done<br>

In 2012 The gambler was remade with a modern flair.
It was called "Money Trees", The lyrics are not safe for work but we can all agree that money trees are the perfect place for shade.
